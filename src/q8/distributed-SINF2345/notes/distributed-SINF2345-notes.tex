(Need slide to understand)

\section{Teaser}

\subsection{Parallel and distributed computing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parallel computing : many node, optimize performance, no
        failure
    \item[$\to$] Tightly coupled(low latency/delay and high performance)

    \item Distributed computing : many node in collaboration with
        \textcolor{red}{partial failure}
    \item[$\to$] Loosely coupled(high latency and low perfomance)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Consensus}
Atomic broadcast $\equiv$ consensus (proof slide 13)

It's possible to resolve consensus if we have atomic broadcast and vice-versa.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item broadcast $\to$ consensus : We take the first proposal as they have an order 
    \item consensus $\to$ broadcast : The subject of the consensus is the order to take.
\end{enumerate}

Paxos est ce qui est le plus utilisé pour les consensus (TODO)

\begin{itemize}
    \item Asynchronous : There is no bound on the time for a message to arrive and to be computed, it resolve consensus iff 0 node crashes
    \item Partially synchronous : It start asynchronous and then become synchronous(it get an upper bound, we know it will happen but we don't know when.
	  Consensus sit < $\frac{n}{2}$ crashes
    \item Synchronous : Bound known for delivering and computation of message.Consensus with n-1 crashes
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Asynchronous vs Synchronous}

Bound is simulated with a expect bound to be in partially synchronous.

\subsection{Failure detector}
Bound exist but we don't know the exact value because this bound can
change with time (if RTT increase for example)

\section{Formal models of distributed system}

\section{Formalisation}

\subsection{Local Vs Global}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Local (one node = State)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Atomic
            \item Deterministic
        \end{itemize}
    \item Global (many node = Configuration)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Non-atomic (because piece of code in many node
            \item Non deterministic (because network and reveiv order message)
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Synchronous Vs Asynchronous}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Asynchronous
    \item Synchronous : Use round to synchronous (like clock) and this
        is use to detect failure
\end{itemize}
